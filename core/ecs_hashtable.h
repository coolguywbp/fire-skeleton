    A hashtable implementation.

    Due to the use of an unsigned integer for the hash type, the index '0'
    does double-duty as both a regular index and an invalid index.

    The functions ht_next, ht_get_free, and ht_get_next_free treat 0 as an
    invalid or un-indexable value. All other functions treat 0 as valid.
